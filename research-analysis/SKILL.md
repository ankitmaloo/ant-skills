name: research-analysis
description: Rigorous epistemological analysis of novel research ideas. Use when evaluating new research concepts, hypotheses, or innovative ideas that may be outside mainstream knowledge. Focuses on systematic inquiry, identifying knowns/unknowns, logical dependencies, and verification through literature search rather than defaulting to agreement or dismissal.

# Research Analysis Methodology

## Purpose

This skill provides a systematic framework for analyzing novel research ideas with intellectual rigor. It addresses the tendency to either uncritically accept ideas or dismiss them without proper analysis by implementing a structured epistemological approach.

## Core Principles

1. **Suspend Immediate Judgment**: Do not default to agreeing or disagreeing. Begin with genuine curiosity.
2. **Systematic Decomposition**: Break ideas into constituent parts and logical dependencies.
3. **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Use extensive literature search to ground analysis in existing knowledge.
4. **Identify Boundaries**: Clearly distinguish what is known, unknown, and unknowable with current information.
5. **Logical Rigor**: Apply formal reasoning methods including conditional logic, negation, and proof techniques.

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Idea Crystallization

**Goal**: Ensure complete understanding before evaluation.

1. **Restate the Idea**
   - Paraphrase the core claim or hypothesis in your own words
   - Identify the key variables, entities, or concepts involved
   - Extract the fundamental assertion being made

2. **Identify Ambiguities**
   - What terms are used that might have multiple interpretations?
   - What implicit assumptions are being made?
   - What scope or boundary conditions are unclear?

3. **Generate Clarifying Questions**
   - What information is needed to fully understand the idea?
   - What context is missing?
   - What are the intended applications or implications?

**Output**: A clear, unambiguous statement of the research idea and list of clarifying questions.

---

### Phase 2: Epistemological Mapping

**Goal**: Map the landscape of knowledge surrounding the idea.

#### 2.1 Known Territory
- What established facts or theories relate to this idea?
- What prior work exists in adjacent areas?
- What empirical evidence currently exists?

**Action**: Conduct comprehensive literature search:
- Google Scholar for academic papers
- arXiv for recent preprints (especially in physics, CS, math, bio)
- Google Search for related concepts, terminology, and discussions
- Search for counterexamples or contradictory evidence

#### 2.2 Unknown Territory
- What aspects of this idea have not been studied?
- What experiments or observations would be needed?
- What questions does this idea raise that cannot currently be answered?

#### 2.3 Knowledge Gaps
- What are we uncertain about?
- Where does current evidence conflict?
- What assumptions are we making due to lack of information?

**Output**: A structured map of knowns, unknowns, and knowledge gaps with citations.

---

### Phase 3: Logical Decomposition

**Goal**: Analyze the logical structure and dependencies of the idea.

#### 3.1 Conditional Chain Analysis ("If X, then Y")
Identify logical dependencies:
- What are the necessary conditions for this idea to be true?
- What would necessarily follow if this idea is true?
- What intermediate steps or lemmas must hold?

Example:
```
If idea I is true, then:
  → Consequence C1 must hold
    → Which implies C2
    → Which requires assumption A1
  → Prediction P1 should be observable
  → Existing phenomenon E1 should have explanation X
```

#### 3.2 Negation Analysis
Apply proof by contradiction:
- What would it mean if the idea is false?
- What contradictions arise if we assume the negation?
- What evidence would definitively disprove the idea?

#### 3.3 Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions
- Where does the idea apply and not apply?
- What are the extreme cases?
- What simplifying assumptions might break down?

**Output**: A logical dependency graph showing how the idea connects to other claims.

---

### Phase 4: Evidence Evaluation

**Goal**: Assess the empirical and theoretical support for the idea.

#### 4.1 Search for Supporting Evidence
Use Google Search and arXiv to find:
- Direct empirical support
- Theoretical frameworks that align
- Analogous phenomena in other domains
- Expert opinions and discussions

**Search Strategy**:
1. Core concept keywords
2. Related technical terms
3. Analogies and metaphors
4. Contradictory terms (to find counterarguments)
5. Recent papers (last 1-3 years for cutting edge)

#### 4.2 Search for Contradicting Evidence
Actively seek disconfirmation:
- What evidence would contradict this idea?
- Has anyone attempted this and failed?
- What are known limitations in related areas?

#### 4.3 Assess Quality of Evidence
- How reliable are the sources?
- Are there conflicts of interest or biases?
- How strong is the statistical or logical support?
- Are there alternative explanations for the same observations?

**Output**: Evidence inventory with quality assessment and citations.

### Phase 5: Merit Assessment

**Goal**: Synthesize analysis into an evaluation of the idea's merit.

#### 5.1 Novelty Assessment
- Is this genuinely new or a recombination of existing ideas?
- Has this been proposed before under different terminology?
- What unique contribution does it make?

#### 5.2 Feasibility Assessment
- Is it theoretically possible given known physics/mathematics/constraints?
- What resources or capabilities would be required to test it?
- What are the practical barriers to implementation?

#### 5.3 Impact Assessment
- If true, what would be the significance?
- What problems would it solve?
- What new questions would it open?

#### 5.4 Confidence Levels
Assign confidence levels to different aspects:
- Theoretical soundness: [Low/Medium/High]
- Empirical support: [Low/Medium/High]
- Novelty: [Low/Medium/High]
- Feasibility: [Low/Medium/High]
- Potential impact: [Low/Medium/High]

#### 5.5 Research Directions
Based on the analysis, what are the next steps?
- What experiments should be conducted?
- What theoretical work is needed?
- What collaborations or expertise would be valuable?
- What simpler versions or toy models could be explored first?

**Output**: A comprehensive merit assessment with justified confidence levels.

## Reasoning Techniques

### 1. Peeling the Onion
Layer-by-layer investigation:
- Surface claim → Underlying mechanism → Fundamental principles
- Each layer raises new questions
- Continue until hitting well-established ground or fundamental unknowns

### 2. Steelman the Argument
Construct the strongest possible version:
- What would make this idea most likely to be true?
- What additional assumptions would make it work?
- What is the best case scenario?

Then critically examine even the strongest version.

### 3. Falsification Mindset
Actively try to break the idea:
- What is the weakest link?
- What single piece of evidence would disprove it?
- What experiments could be done to test it?

### 4. Analogical Reasoning
Find parallel cases:
- Have similar ideas worked in other domains?
- Are there structural analogies to known phenomena?
- What can we learn from analogous failures or successes?

### 5. Dimensional Analysis
Check for internal consistency:
- Do the units/dimensions work out?
- Are there order-of-magnitude issues?
- Do the scaling laws make sense?

## Search Strategy

### Effective Web Search Queries

For each novel idea, construct multiple search queries:

1. **Direct searches**:
   - Exact key terms from the idea
   - Technical terminology
   - Author names if applicable

2. **Conceptual searches**:
   - Related concepts and frameworks
   - Analogous phenomena
   - Broader field or domain

3. **Critical searches**:
   - "[concept] criticism"
   - "[concept] problems"
   - "[concept] limitations"
   - "why [concept] won't work"

4. **Temporal searches**:
   - Recent papers (add "2023", "2024", "2025")
   - Historical development
   - State of the art

5. **arXiv specific**:
   - Search within relevant categories (cs.AI, physics.gen-ph, etc.)
   - Look for recent preprints
   - Check author profiles for related work

### Iterative Search Process

1. Start broad, then narrow based on findings
2. Follow citation trails (both forward and backward)
3. Look for review papers and surveys
4. Check for replication attempts or meta-analyses
5. Cross-reference across different sources

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Premature Agreement**: Don't say "you're absolutely right" without thorough analysis
2. **Premature Dismissal**: Don't reject ideas as "impossible" without evidence
3. **Surface-Level Analysis**: Don't stop at the first layer of questioning
4. **Confirmation Bias**: Don't only search for supporting evidence
5. **Appeal to Authority**: Don't accept or reject based solely on who proposed it
6. **False Precision**: Don't claim certainty where uncertainty exists
7. **Analysis Paralysis**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good - synthesize findings

---

## Example Workflow

When presented with a novel research idea:

1. **Acknowledge receipt**: "Let me analyze this research idea systematically."

## Notes

- This methodology is designed to be thorough but not exhaustive. Adapt based on the complexity and scope of the idea.
- Always be explicit about confidence levels and uncertainties.
- The goal is intellectual honesty, not defending or attacking the idea.
- Novel ideas often exist in uncertain territory - embrace and acknowledge this uncertainty while still providing useful analysis.
